  GraphQL Usage

  Ticket Creation (Customer)
  mutation {
  createTicket(input: {
    title: "Login not working",
    description: "Can't access dashboard",
    file: null
  }) {
    ticket {
      id
      title
      status
    }
  }
}




Add Comment (Customer/Agent)
mutation {
  addComment(input: {
    ticketId: 1,
    body: "Please reset your password and try again."
  }) {
    comment {
      id
      body
      createdAt
    }
  }
}
 Known Issues
Render cold starts can delay response on first load.

File uploads require S3 or third-party config in production.





 If More Time Was Available
Add admin dashboard for agents.

Set up cloud storage (e.g. S3) for real file handling.

Add Pundit for fine-grained authorization rules.

Improve GraphQL query performance and add pagination.
